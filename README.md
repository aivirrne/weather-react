## What I have learned

1. **Deepened my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Working on this project helped me consolidate and improve my skills, as I already had some basic knowledge of these foundational web technologies.
2. **Learned the basics of React**. This included gaining a better understanding of concepts like components, state, props, and lifecycle methods.
3. **Discovered how to work with APIs**. Using the OpenWeather API helped me gain a deeper understanding of how to consume APIs, handle responses, and how to read the API documentation.
4. **Became comfortable using GitHub for version control**. This helped me tracking of my progress over time and manage my code changes, which is an important skill to develop as a software developer or tester.
5. **Discovered the benefits of using CSS frameworks**, like Bootstrap, which helped speed up my development process.
